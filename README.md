# Deep Learning Homework 1 - Linear Regression and Neural Network Regression

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for Homework 1 in the deep learning course. In this assignment, we trained multiple deep learning models on the "cancer_reg.csv" dataset and compared their performance based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) score.

## Repository Structure

- `hw1_5173.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for training and evaluating the deep learning models.
- `cancer_reg.csv`: The dataset used for this assignment.
- `screenshot/`: This folder contains screenshots showing the performance graphs, epochs, MSE, and R^2 scores for each model. The screenshots are named according to their position in the R^2 performance table in the documentation (e.g., "1_2" corresponds to row 1, column 2).
- `hw1_document.pdf`: The documentation file that provides a detailed explanation of the assignment, the models used, and the analysis of results.

## Instructions

To replicate the results and analysis presented in this assignment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-hw1.git

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook and change the arguments in the "test_model" function to test the model.
